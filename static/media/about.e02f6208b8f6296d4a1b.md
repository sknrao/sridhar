However, my true passion is teaching - and I am a Professor Emeritus / Professor of Practice at a Rural Engineering College [CIT, Gubbi](https://cittumkur.org) since 2013. My work at CIT is about improving the computational thinking skills in Students. I'm spending lot of time on problem-solving techniques in Mathematics.
